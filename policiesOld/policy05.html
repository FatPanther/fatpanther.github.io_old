<p>STUDIO POLICY
2005-2006</p>

<p><span style='font-family:Baskerville;font-weight:normal'>For
a detailed schedule of this years lessons, recitals, group lessons, and OMTA
syllabus, please refer to the calendar page. &nbsp;The studio follows the
same schedule as the public school year. &nbsp;The studio
is closed during winter break and no lessons will be taught. &nbsp;During spring break the studio will be
open for those students interested in having a lesson during that week, lessons
during this week are billed separately from regular tuition. &nbsp;The summer schedule is
flexible. &nbsp;Please refer to the calendar for specific
dates.</p>

<h4><u>Tuition and
Payment</u></h4>

<p>Payments are due at
the beginning of each month with the exception of September – payment for
September is due the first week of lessons – September 12.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A free lesson is offered during
make-up weeks for students who have perfect attendance during the term.<span>&nbsp; </span>The last monthly payment for school
year lessons is due June 1. &nbsp;There
will be no formal billing. &nbsp;
However, a late fee of $10.00 will apply to any payments received after
the 10<sup>th</sup> of the month.</p>

<p>The monthly fee is
based on 33 individual lessons over the 10 month school year.</p>

<p>Payment Schedule:</p>

<p>30
minute lessons:<u><strong>$66.00/month </strong></u></p>

<p>45 minute lessons: <b><u>$99.00/month</u>
</b></p>

<p>60
minute lessons: <b><u>$132.00/month</u> </b></p>

<p><b>Summer
lessons:</b></p>

<p>30
minute lesson: $20.00 each</p>

<p>45
minute lesson: $30.00 each</p>

<p>60
minute lesson: $40.00 each</p>

<p><b>Summer
lessons are billed monthly based on how many lessons the student takes. &nbsp;Summer lessons are more flexible to
allow for vacations. Summer billing begins June 19.</b></p>

<p>An additional fee of
$25.00 per year/ per student will be charged to cover recitals, group lessons, and various materials. &nbsp;This fee is
collected at the beginning of the fall term.</p>
<h4><u>Attendance, Illness and Make-ups</u></h4>

<p>Because regular
attendance is essential to musical growth, a commitment to lessons for the
duration of the term is expected when a student enrolls. &nbsp;There can be no tuition deduction or
reimbursement for missed lessons. &nbsp;Students should arrive no more than 5 minutes early and leave promptly
at the conclusion of the lesson. &nbsp;I
cannot be responsible for a student once the lesson is over.</p>

<p>Make-up lessons are
limited to <b>ONE PER TERM</b>,
and <i>only for absences due to illness </i>and with 24 hour notice. &nbsp;
Make-up lessons will be given the week following the regular term or at
our mutual convenience. &nbsp;There are <b>no
exceptions</b> to this policy.</p>

<p>Make up lessons will
be offered during the following weeks:</p>

<p><b>Fall Term: &nbsp;December 12-16</b></p>

<p><b>Winter Term: &nbsp;March 20-24</b></p>

<p><b>Spring Term: &nbsp;June 12-16</b></p>

<p>Because schedules are
complicated and sports events are sometimes unpredictable, I will issue a copy
of my schedule as a <b>swap list</b>. &nbsp;In the case of an <i>anticipated
absence, </i>students may arrange
to exchange lesson times with another student. &nbsp;Please notify me promptly if a lesson is exchanged or must
be cancelled. &nbsp;<b>New! &nbsp;</b>A free lesson will be offered to &nbsp;students who don’t miss any lessons over the course of a
term. &nbsp;This lesson will be given at
the usual scheduled lesson time during the week of make-up lessons.</p>

<p>For students with
Monday lessons, there are two holidays during the spring term. &nbsp;The lessons will be rescheduled for a
time during the same week as the holiday or during the make-up lesson week.</p>

<p>In the event that I
must cancel a scheduled lesson, I will provide a make-up or a refund.</p>

<h4><u>Practice</u></h4>

<p>Progress at the piano
depends on daily practice, which should assume the <i>same priority as homework</i>. &nbsp;
Practice is most effective when the student is alert and
undisturbed. &nbsp;Most students find
that setting a regular practice time helps them to be consistent. &nbsp;Some students may choose two short
practice sessions rather than one long one. &nbsp;The piano should be in tune and away from family
distractions. &nbsp;<i>Fingernails must
be short</i> in order to use the
hands comfortably and correctly at the keyboard. &nbsp;The student and I will decide on a manageable daily practice
period that can be accomplished 5 times per week.</p>

<p><b><u>Lending
Library</u></b></p>

<p>The studio is
continually building its lending library from which students are able to borrow
literature. &nbsp;A record of books on
loan will be kept. &nbsp;Students are
expected to return all books on loan at the end of the school year, if not
before. &nbsp;Students will be charged
for any books lost, damaged or not returned.</p>

<h4><u>Purchasing books</u></h4>

<p>Any books purchased by
the teacher for the student will be billed in addition to the regular monthly
fee. &nbsp;Parents and students
should expect to spend a <b>maximum</b>
of $25.00 per term, per student on books.</p>

<h4><u>Performances and Group Lessons</u></h4>

<p>Two recitals will be
held each year, one in December and one in May. &nbsp;All students will prepare a piece for these events and will
be asked to share their music at these recitals.</p>

<p>Group lessons will be
held once per term, please see the calendar for specific dates.</p>

<p>Opportunities to
participate in OMTA syllabus, festivals, competitions and other recitals will
be made on an individual basis based on the expressed interest of the student
and the care taken in preparation for such events.</p>

<h4><u>Materials</u></h4>

<p>All students are
required to have an adequate instrument to practice on, a metronome and three
ring binder for practice records and assignments. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>*** Please feel free
to call or email me with any questions or concerns about lessons. &nbsp;I am looking forward to working with
you all to create a rewarding musical year!</p>
