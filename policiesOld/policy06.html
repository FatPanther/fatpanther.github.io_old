  <font face=Baskerville size=4>Attendance, Illness and Make-ups</font>
</h4>
<p class=western>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>Because regular attendance is essential to musical
  growth, <b>a commitment to lessons for</b> <b>the duration of the term is
  expected when a student enrolls</b>. There can be no tuition deduction or
  reimbursement for missed lessons. Students should arrive no more than 5
  minutes early and leave promptly at the conclusion of the lesson. I cannot be
  responsible for a student once the lesson is over.</font>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>Make-up lessons are limited to <b>ONE PER TERM</b>, and
  <i>only for absences due to illness </i>and with 24 hour notice. Make-up
  lessons will be given the week following the regular term or at our mutual
  convenience. There are <b>no exceptions</b> to this policy.</font>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western>
  <font face=Baskerville>Make up lessons will be offered during the following
  weeks:</font>
</p>
<p class=western>
  <font face=Baskerville><b>Fall Term: December 11-15</b></font>
</p>
<p class=western>
  <font face=Baskerville><b>Winter Term: March 19-23</b></font>
</p>
<p class=western>
  <font face=Baskerville><b>Spring Term: June 11-15</b></font>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>Because schedules are complicated and sports events are
  sometimes unpredictable, I will issue a copy of my schedule as a <b>swap
  list</b>. In the case of an <i>anticipated absence, </i>students may arrange
  to exchange lesson times with another student. Please notify me promptly if a
  lesson is exchanged or must be cancelled. <b>A free lesson</b> will be offered
  to students who don’t miss any lessons over the course of a term. This lesson
  will be given at the usual scheduled lesson time during the week of make-up
  lessons.</font>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>For students with Monday lessons, there are two
  holidays during the spring term. The lessons will be rescheduled for a time
  during the same week as the holiday or during the make-up lesson week.</font>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>In the event that I must cancel a scheduled lesson, I
  will provide a make-up or a refund.</font>

  <font face=Baskerville><font size=4><u>Practice</u></font></font>
</h1>
<p class=western style="">
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style="">
  <font face=Baskerville>Progress at the piano depends on daily practice, which
  should assume the <i>same priority as homework</i>. Practice is most effective
  when the student is alert and undisturbed. Most students find that setting a
  regular practice time helps them to be consistent. Some students may choose
  two short practice sessions rather than one long one. The piano should be in
  tune and away from family distractions. <i>Fingernails must be short</i> in
  order to use the hands comfortably and correctly at the keyboard. The student
  and I will decide on a manageable daily practice period that can be
  accomplished 5 times per week. <b>Together with their parents, students will
  find a regular time to practice during the day. </b></font>
