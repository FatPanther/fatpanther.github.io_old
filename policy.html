Summer lessons will be offered on a weekly basis.  </span><span class="c6 c4 c2">Please refer to the calendar for specific dates.</span></p>
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Tuition and Payment</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Students are required to sign up for one full term.  Payment for lessons is due at the beginning of each term.  Arrangements for tuition payments to be broken into two installments may be made.  A free lesson is offered during make-up weeks for students who have not missed any lessons during the term.  </span></p>
	<p class="c7 c3"><span class="c6 c4 c2">Payment Schedule:</span></p>

	<p></p>
	<p class="c7 c3"><span class="c6 c4 c2">Summer lessons will be scheduled on an individual basis.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Attendance, Illness and Make-ups</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because regular attendance is essential to musical growth,</span><span class="c4 c2"> a commitment to lessons for the duration of the term is expected when a student enrolls</span><span class="c2">.  There can be no tuition deduction or reimbursement for missed lessons.  Should a student decide mid-term to discontinue lessons &ndash; there will be no tuition reimbursement.  Students should arrive no more than 5 minutes early and leave promptly at the conclusion of the lesson.  I cannot be responsible for a student once the lesson is over.</span></p>
	
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Make-up lessons are limited to</span><span class="c4 c2"> ONE PER TERM during the make-up lesson week</span><span class="c2">, and</span><span class="c9 c2"> only for absences due to illness</span><span class="c2"> and with 24 hour notice.  Make-up lessons will be given the week following the regular term.  There are</span><span class="c4 c2"> no exceptions</span><span class="c2"> to this policy.</span></p>
	
	<p class="c7 c3"><span class="c6 c4 c2">Make up lessons will be offered during the following weeks:</span></p>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2">
	Fall Term:  December 15th-19th<br>
	Winter Term:  March 16th-20th<br>
	Spring Term:  June 8th-12th
		</span></p>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because schedules are complicated and sports events are sometimes unpredictable, I will issue a copy of my schedule as a</span><span class="c4 c2"> swap list</span><span class="c2">.  In the case of an</span><span class="c9 c2"> anticipated absence,</span><span class="c2"> students may arrange to exchange lesson times with another student.  Please notify me promptly if a lesson is exchanged or must be cancelled.  </span><span class="c4 c2">A free lesson</span><span class="c2"> will be offered to students who don&rsquo;t miss any lessons over the course of a term.  This lesson will be given at the usual scheduled lesson time during the week of make-up lessons.</span></p>
	
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">For students with</span><span class="c4 c2"> Monday lessons</span><span class="c2">, regular lessons will be taught on holidays.  If you are unable to attend, a makeup lesson will be scheduled.</span></p>
	
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the event that I must cancel a scheduled lesson, I will provide a make-up or a refund.  If lessons must be cancelled due to inclement weather, arrangements will be made for make-up lessons.</span></p>
	
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Practice</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2">Parents are responsible for making sure that students practice the material they have been assigned a minimum of 5 days a week.  </span><span class="c2">Depending on the age of the student, parents will need to sit down with the student each day to ensure that students practice each assignment as laid out on the assignment sheet.  This will continue for a few years for younger students.  It is essential that parents understand the level of commitment they need to make to ensure each student&#39;s success.  </span><span class="c4 c2">Progress at the piano depends on daily practice, which should assume the</span><span class="c9 c4 c2"> same priority as homework</span><span class="c4 c2">.</span><span class="c2">  Practice is most effective when the student is alert and undisturbed.  Most students find that setting a regular practice time helps them to be consistent.  Some students may choose two short practice sessions rather than one long one.  The piano</span><span> </span><span class="c2">should be in tune and away from family distractions.  </span><span class="c9 c2">Fingernails must be short</span><span class="c2"> in order to use the hands comfortably and correctly at the keyboard.  </span><span class="c4 c2">Together with their parents, students will find a regular time to practice during the day.  If it seems difficult in the beginning, just wait!  It gets easier!  Students will begin to see the results of their steady, daily practice.  Parents too will fall into a routine of helping the child complete their assignment.</span></p>

	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Lending Library</span></h6>

	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">The studio is continually building its lending library from which students are able to borrow literature.  A record of books on loan will be kept.  Students are expected to return all books on loan at the end of the school year, if not before.  Students will be charged for any books lost, damaged or not returned.  </span></p>
	
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Purchasing books</span></h6>
	
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Any books purchased by the teacher for the student will be billed in addition to tuition.</span></p>
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Recitals and Group Lessons</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Two recitals will be held this year.  All students will prepare a piece to perform from memory at the recitals.</span></p>
	
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Students should dress up for the recital.  Please no old jeans or dirty sneakers.  Please no face paint.  Taking care in how you present yourself at the recital is part of preparing for your performance!</span></p>

	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Group lessons will be held each term; please see the calendar for specific dates.  </span></p>
	
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">OMTA Syllabus, Guild Auditions &amp; OMTA Festivals</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">These events are optional.  Please let me know if you would like to participate.</span></p>
	<h6 class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c2">Materials</span></h6>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">All students are required to have an adequate instrument to practice on, a metronome and three ring binder with at least 5 tabs for practice records and assignments.</span></p>
	<p class="c3"><span class="c2">*** Please feel free to call or email me with any questions or concerns about lessons.  I am looking forward to working with you all to create a rewarding musical year!</span></p>
