  Monica Sanders has been playing the piano since the age of 5 when she began
      her studies with Deborah Mele in Santa Barbara, California. Her love of
      music guided
    her through to graduate school at Portland State University where she received
    her Master of Arts in Teaching Piano in 2004. She was also the recipient
      of the Beaux Arts Society Scholarship in 2004.</p>

    teaches the course What Every Musician Needs to Know About the Body at Portland
    Community
  College, where she also teaches private piano lessons. She is currently pursuing
  her certification as an Andover Educator.</p>
<p class="mainText"> <br>
  Monica has studied with Christine Mirabella, Claire Wachter, Lisa Marsh, Carol
  Rich, Toby Koenigsberg, Randy Porter and Barbara Conable, all of whom have
