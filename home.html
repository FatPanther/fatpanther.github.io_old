    <span style="font-weight:normal;"><p>"Monica has been the best teacher I've ever had. Not only is she excellent at helping with the fundamentals of reading music, building technique, and understanding the music theory behind the pieces, but she also excels in helping to unlock what gives music character, giving the student the ability to understand the emotions within a given piece and to express them in an authentic fashion."  <span style="font-weight:bold">- Thomas D., Composition student PSU</span></p>
    <p>"Monica is a wonderful piano teacher.  She's warm, professional, encouraging and incredibly knowledgeable.  Each week I look forward to my lessons with her because I'm consistently amazed at how much I can learn in just one hour.  Leaving Monica's studio, I'm always inspired to immediately go work on what we went over.  I really appreciate that she takes the time to focus not only on repertoire, but warm ups, technique, theory, sight reading, and understanding how the body is structured/moves to play more comfortably and efficiently.  I highly recommend her as a piano teacher to people of all ages and skill levels." <span style="font-weight:bold">- Aliza P., piano student, PCC</span></p></span>
